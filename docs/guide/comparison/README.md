# Comparison

When people migrate, they would like to know what to expect from the scoring. 
So here is a comparison between the original [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) and rewritten [zxcvbn-ts](https://github.com/zxcvbn-ts/zxcvbn)

The scoring could have slight changes' duo to various reasons.
- updated dictionaries (generally more words and dictionaries that are up-to-date)
- bug fixes
- more keyboard layouts
- more matchers

If you think the scoring is completely out of place, please open a [discussion](https://github.com/zxcvbn-ts/zxcvbn/discussions) inside the repository.
