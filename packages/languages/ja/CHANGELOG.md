- feat!: makes language packages tree shakeable (#176) ([3be6ae2](https://github.com/zxcvbn-ts/zxcvbn/commit/3be6ae2ae3f4ff7ade756df50c60274cbc2b0e20)), closes [#176](https://github.com/zxcvbn-ts/zxcvbn/issues/176) [#175](https://github.com/zxcvbn-ts/zxcvbn/issues/175)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Language packages no longer has a default export.

Instead of importing language packages with
`import package from '@zxcvbn-ts/language-en'`

You will now have to import it either like this
`import { dictionary, translations } from '@zxcvbn-ts/language-en'`

or like this
`import * as package from '@zxcvbn-ts/language-en'`

The reason for the change is so that you can tree shake the
dictionary and translations.
